Throughout the game, White played strategically by aiming to control the center, create pawn weaknesses in Black's position, and initiate piece exchanges to simplify the position. On the other hand, Black focused on solidifying their position, developing pieces harmoniously, and aiming for tactical opportunities.

Considering the current position and White's material advantage, as well as the strategic play so far, White is likely to have an upper hand in the game. The strategy employed by White involved creating positional pressure, exploiting pawn weaknesses, and making efficient piece exchanges. Black needs to find tactical resources to counter White's material advantage and try to complicate the position to have chances of turning the game in their favor."
