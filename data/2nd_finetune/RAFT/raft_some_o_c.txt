Therefore, Tardo's focus and interest were primarily directed towards investigating the presence or absence of slavery on the planet.

<ANSWER>: Tardo was most intent on the question of slavery.
=====
What was the reason for having to walk on the planet?
=====
Tardo had seemed most intent on the question of slavery, and Peo looked for signs of it. He could see none. The people of the planet had had time to conceal some things, of course. But the people they saw in the village wore a proud air of independence no slave could assume.  Saranta apologized for their having to walk, explaining that there was no other means of transportation on the planet.

=====
Given the context provided, the reason for having to walk on the planet is explained by Saranta, who apologized and mentioned that there was no other means of transportation available. This indicates that walking was necessary due to the lack of alternative transportation options on the planet.

Therefore, the reason for having to walk on the planet is: due to the absence of other transportation options.
=====
What is the reason for the lack of technology development on the planet?
=====
Saranta apologized for their having to walk, explaining that there was no other means of transportation on the planet.  "And, without transportation, you can understand why we have not been able to develop a technology," he added. "We hope transport will be included in the first assistance you will give us."  Tardo asked about the fields.  "I see there is no one working them," he said. "Is that done by the villagers?"

=====
 The context provided indicates that the lack of technology development on the planet is attributed to the absence of transportation infrastructure. Saranta explains that without transportation, the development of technology has been hindered.
- The mention of fields not being worked by villagers is not directly relevant to the question about the lack of technology development.
- To answer the question, we can focus on the statement made by Saranta regarding the impact of transportation on technology development.
- Saranta states, "And, without transportation, you can understand why we have not been able to develop a technology." This implies that the inability to access transportation has limited the planet's ability to advance technologically.
- Therefore, the reason for the lack of technology development on the planet is the absence of transportation infrastructure.
<ANSWER>: The reason for the lack of technology development on the planet is the absence of transportation infrastructure.

=====
Given the context provided, Saranta mentioned that there was no means of transportation on the planet, which hindered the development of technology. Tardo inquired about the fields and observed that no one was working on them. To answer the question of who is responsible for working the fields on the planet, we can infer that it is likely the villagers who are responsible for working the fields. This can be deduced from Tardo's question, "Is that done by the villagers?" which implies that the villagers are typically the ones who work the fields.

<ANSWER>: The villagers are responsible for working the fields on the planet.
=====
Who typically works the fields in the village?
=====
Tardo asked about the fields.  "I see there is no one working them," he said. "Is that done by the villagers?"  "Our labor supply is transient," answered Saranta after a moment's hesitation. "The laborers who will work our fields--for a wage, of course--are probably in the next town or the one beyond it now."  Alpha Persei was sinking in the western sky when Tardo and Peo took their leave of Saranta and made their way down the road toward their planetary landing craft.

Why did Tardo decide against recommending technical aid for the world?
=====
Alpha Persei was sinking in the western sky when Tardo and Peo took their leave of Saranta and made their way down the road toward their planetary landing craft.  "It looks like a good world to me," said Peo. "If tomorrow's inspection is as satisfactory, I suppose you will recommend the beginning of technical aid?"  "There will be no inspection tour tomorrow, and I shall recommend against aid at this time," replied Tardo. "I've seen enough."  "Why?" asked Peo, surprised.

=====
To answer the question of why Tardo decided against recommending technical aid for the world, we can analyze the provided context. Tardo and Peo were on a mission to inspect the world, and despite Peo's positive assessment, Tardo decided against recommending aid. Tardo's decision was based on his own observations during the inspection, as he stated, "I've seen enough."

Therefore, the reason Tardo decided against recommending technical aid for the world was due to his personal observations during the inspection, which led him to believe that aid was not necessary at that time.

<ANSWER>: Tardo decided against recommending technical aid for the world based on his own observations during the inspection.

Given the context provided, Tardo and Peo were discussing their observations and decisions regarding the planet they were on. Tardo had seen enough and decided against recommending technical aid at that time. Peo was surprised and asked why. The sinking of Alpha Persei in the western sky was just the setting for this conversation and not directly related to their actions.

To answer the question, we can focus on the dialogue between Tardo and Peo:
- Tardo decided against recommending technical aid at that time.
- Peo was surprised and asked why.

Therefore, as Alpha Persei was sinking in the western sky, Tardo and Peo were discussing Tardo's decision against recommending technical aid on the planet they were on.

What are the two classes of people on the planet according to Tardo?
=====
"There will be no inspection tour tomorrow, and I shall recommend against aid at this time," replied Tardo. "I've seen enough."  "Why?" asked Peo, surprised.  "There are two classes of people on this planet, and we've seen only one," said Tardo. "Those we have seen are freemen. The others are no better than animals. We give no aid that helps men tighten their hold over their fellows."

=====
 The relevant part of the context is when Tardo mentions, "There are two classes of people on this planet, and we've seen only one."
- Tardo is stating that there are two classes of people on the planet: freemen and those who are no better than animals.
- The context does not provide further details on the characteristics or distinctions between these two classes of people.
- To answer the question, we can directly extract the information provided by Tardo: "There are two classes of people on this planet, and we've seen only one."
- Therefore, the answer to the question is: 
<ANSWER>: The two classes of people on the planet according to Tardo are freemen and those who are no better than animals.

=====
To answer the question, we need to analyze the given context where Tardo recommends against aid at this time. Tardo's reasoning for this decision is based on his observation of two classes of people on the planet. He mentions that the group they have encountered are freemen, while the other class is considered no better than animals. Tardo believes that providing aid could potentially help the freemen tighten their hold over the other class, which he finds unacceptable.

Therefore, Tardo recommends against aid at this time to prevent any assistance that could further empower one group over another, as he sees it as detrimental to the overall situation on the planet.

<ANSWER>: Tardo recommends against aid at this time to avoid enabling the freemen to tighten their hold over the other class.

What was the challenge faced by colonizing ships 1000 years ago?
=====
"If you haven't seen them, how do you know there is another class?" demanded Peo. "There is no evidence of any such situation."  "The evidence is well hidden. But if you think your stomach can take it now, I'll tell you. If you remember your history, colonizing ships 1000 years ago had no space to carry animals along. They had to depend on native animal life of the planet, and this planet had none."  "Saranta said that. But I don't see ..."

=====
Given the context provided, the challenge faced by colonizing ships 1000 years ago was the lack of space to carry animals along. They had to depend on the native animal life of the planet they were colonizing, which in this case had none.

Here's how to answer the question step by step:
1. Peo questions the existence of another class, to which the response mentions the hidden evidence and the historical context of colonizing ships.
2. The response highlights that colonizing ships 1000 years ago had limited space to carry animals, forcing them to rely on the native animal life of the planet they were colonizing.
3. The planet being discussed in the context had no native animal life, presenting a significant challenge for the colonizers.

Therefore, the challenge faced by colonizing ships 1000 years ago was the lack of space to carry animals and the dependence on native animal life, which was non-existent in some cases.

<ANSWER>: The challenge faced by colonizing ships 1000 years ago was the limited space to carry animals and the reliance on native animal life of the planet being colonized.
=====
Why did colonizing ships have to depend on native animal life of the planet they landed on?
=====
"If you haven't seen them, how do you know there is another class?" demanded Peo. "There is no evidence of any such situation."  "The evidence is well hidden. But if you think your stomach can take it now, I'll tell you. If you remember your history, colonizing ships 1000 years ago had no space to carry animals along.

=====
Given the context provided, the reason colonizing ships had to depend on native animal life of the planet they landed on was due to the lack of space to carry animals along during colonization 1000 years ago. This limitation forced them to rely on the local fauna for various purposes. 

Therefore, the colonizing ships had to depend on native animal life of the planet they landed on because they did not have the capacity to carry animals with them during their journey. 

<ANSWER>: Colonizing ships had to depend on native animal life of the planet they landed on due to limited space for carrying animals during colonization 1000 years ago.
