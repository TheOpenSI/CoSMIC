In this case, the white player chooses to capture the black knight on d6 with their bishop, which is a reasonable move as it opens up the center of the board and creates a potential attack against the black king."

To do this, the player must first move the knight on f8 to a square where it is not blocking the king's path. The only available square for the knight is d7, so the player moves the knight to d7 (Nd7). This move allows the player to castle kingside by moving the king two squares towards the rook on the kingside (Kd6) and then placing the rook next to the king (Rd1)."
