"I have the following DataFrame: Col1 Col2 Col3 Type 0 1 2 3 1 1 4 5 6 1 2 7 8 9 2 3 10 11 12 2 4 13 14 15 3 5 16 17 18 3 The DataFrame is read from a CSV file. All rows which have Type 1 are on top, followed by the rows with Type 2, followed by the rows with Type 3, etc. I would like to shuffle the order of the DataFrame's rows according to a list. \ For example, give a list [2, 4, 0, 3, 1, 5] and desired result should be: Col1 Col2 Col3 Type 2 7 8 9 2 4 13 14 15 3 0 1 2 3 1 3 10 11 12 2 1 4 5 6 1 5 16 17 18 3 ... How can I achieve this? A: <code> import pandas as pd import numpy as np df = pd.DataFrame({'Col1': [1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16], 'Col2': [2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17], 'Col3': [3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18], 'Type': [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]}) List = np.random.permutation(len(df)) </code> result = ... # put solution in this variable BEGIN SOLUTION <code>",,2
