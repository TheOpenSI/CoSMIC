How many pawns do white have after the following move - e4?,8,"In chess, at the starting position, each player (both white and black) starts with 8 pawns. The standard initial layout has pawns on the second rank (for white) and the seventh rank (for black).

If white plays the move ""e4"", which involves advancing the pawn from e2 to e4, white still has 8 pawns but one of them has moved to the e4 square. So, after the move e4, white still has 8 pawns.",0

- White has pawns on e4 and f2, g2, h2, so White has 7 pawns.
- Black has pawns on d6 and a7, b7, c5, e7, f7, g7, h7, so Black also has 7 pawns.

1. d4 d5
   - No captures.

3. Nf3 c5
   - No captures.

4. c3 Nc6

7. Bg3 cxd4
   - No captures (pawn captured).

8. cxd4 Qb6
   - No captures.

9. Bxd6 Nb4
   - No captures.

10. Bxb4 Qxb4
    - Bishop captures a pawn (1 capture) and the queen captures the bishop (another capture).

11. b3 Bd7
    - No captures.

12. Be2 h6
    - No captures.

13. O-O g5
    - No captures.

14. Ne5 O-O-O
    - No captures.

15. Nxf7 g4
    - Knight captures a pawn (1 capture).

16. Nxh8
    - Knight captures a rook (1 capture).

Now let's count the pieces initially on the board and subtract the captured pieces to find the total pieces remaining.

Initial pieces on the board:
- 16 pawns (8 white, 8 black),
- 2 white rooks, 2 black rooks,
- 2 white knights, 2 black knights,
- 2 white bishops, 2 black bishops,
- 1 white queen, 1 black queen,
- 1 white king, 1 black king.

Total initial pieces: 32.

Captured pieces:
- 3 pawns (one by cxd4, one by Nxf7, and one assumed by pawn exchanges),
- 1 bishop,
- 1 rook.

Total captured: 3 + 1 + 1 = 5.

Therefore, total pieces left on the board: 32 - 5 = 27.

So, there are 27 chess pieces left on the board.",0
"After the following moves - e4 e6 Nc3 Bb4 Nge2 Ne7 a3 Bxc3, how many chess piecess are left on the board?",31,"Let's go through the moves and keep track of the pieces on the board:

1. e4 e6
2. Nc3 Bb4
3. Nge2 Ne7
4. a3 Bxc3

After these moves, the capture move 4...Bxc3 means Black's bishop on b4 captures the White knight on c3.

Initially, each player starts with 16 pieces:
- 1 king
- 1 queen
- 2 rooks
- 2 bishops
- 2 knights
- 8 pawns

Before the capture, there were 32 pieces in total on the board (16 for each player).

In the move 4...Bxc3, the Black bishop captures the White knight. Therefore, one piece has been removed from the board.

So, the number of chess pieces remaining on the board is 32 - 1 = 31.",0

14. Nxg6 (White captures Black's pawn on g6)
15. fxg6 (Black captures White's knight on g6)
16. Bxg6 (White captures Black's pawn on g6)

Now, let's count the captured pieces:
- Black captured: 1 knight (N)
- White captured: 1 bishop (B), 1 pawn (from h6), and 2 pawns (from g6)

Total captured pieces are:
- Black: 1 piece (knight)
- White: 1 piece (bishop) + 3 pieces (pawns)

Since in a standard chess game each player starts with 16 pieces (8 pawns + 2 knights + 2 bishops + 2 rooks + 1 queen + 1 king):
Initial total pieces on the board = 16 (White) + 16 (Black) = 32

Captured pieces = 4 (White captured) + 1 (Black captured) = 5

Remaining pieces on the board = 32 - 5 = 27

So, there are 27 pieces left on the board.",0

In summary, from the initial board setup:
- Each side starts with 16 pieces (8 pawns and 8 pieces).
- One White pawn is captured by Black.
- One Black pawn is captured by White.
- One White knight is captured by Black.
- One Black bishop is captured by White.

So, there were 32 pieces initially. After the stated moves, the captures are:
1. White pawn captured by Black.
2. Black pawn captured by White.
3. White knight captured by Black.
4. Black bishop captured by White.

This totals to 4 pieces captured.

Therefore, the number of pieces left on the board is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \).

So, there are 28 pieces left on the board.",0
