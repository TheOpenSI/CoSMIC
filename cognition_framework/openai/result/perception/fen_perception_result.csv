"Given a chess board state in the following FEN - 1R6/p3k1p1/2p2b2/2Pn4/1BQPB3/P7/6PP/3q2K1 w - - 1 33, what's the position of the Black Queen?",d1,"In the given FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation): 

1R6/p3k1p1/2p2b2/2Pn4/1BQPB3/P7/6PP/3q2K1 w - - 1 33

To find the position of the Black Queen, we need to decode the FEN string. The setup of the pieces is as follows (by the rows from the top to the bottom):

1. 1R6
2. p3k1p1
3. 2p2b2
4. 2Pn4
5. 1BQPB3

"Given a chess board state in the following FEN - r3k2r/pp3p1p/6p1/2pPb3/2Bn4/2N1Q2N/PP4qP/1RBK3R w kq - 0 19, what's the position of the White King?",d1,"In the given FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation) ""r3k2r/pp3p1p/6p1/2pPb3/2Bn4/2N1Q2N/PP4qP/1RBK3R w kq - 0 19"", the White King is located at d1.

Here’s a breakdown of how to determine this:

1. The FEN consists of six fields separated by spaces.
2. The first field represents the piece placement on the board.
3. The chessboard is noted from the 8th rank to the 1st rank, each rank is noted from 'a' to 'h' files.
4. Uppercase letters denote White pieces, and lowercase letters denote Black pieces.
5. 'K' represents the White King.
6. By examining the ranks one by one, we identify where the 'K' is located.

The first field of the given FEN breaks down as follows:
- 8th rank: r3k2r
- 7th rank: pp3p1p
- 6th rank: 6p1
- 5th rank: 2pPb3
- 4th rank: 2Bn4
- 3rd rank: 2N1Q2N
- 2nd rank: PP4qP
- 1st rank: 1RBK3R

In the 1st rank (""1RBK3R""), 'K' is in the 4th position. Each position corresponds to a file (a-h). The 4th file is d.

Therefore, the White King is positioned at d1.",0
