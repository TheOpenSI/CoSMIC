    Here's how to determine the position of the White Queen from the FEN line:
    
    - The FEN line is divided by '/'.
    - The left side contains the chessboard rows known as the ""board state"".
    - The right side contains the chess pieces present in the board state.
    - Each chessboard row is divided by '/'.
    - Each chess piece is represented by a letter.
    - The letter '1' represents an empty square.
    - For example, 'K' represents a White King, 'N' represents  and 'q' represents a Black Queen.
    - The columns are known as ""files"" range from 1-8.
    - The rows are known as ""ranks"" range from a-h.

    ## Response:
    
    The Black Queen is present in the FEN line at position ""e6"".

    1. The FEN line is divided by '/'.
    2. The first part of the FEN line represents the chessboard row known as the ""Board Rows"".
    3. The second part of the FEN line represents the chess pieces present in the board known as the ""Board Columns"".
    4. Each chessboard row is divided by '1' or ' ' (empty square).
    5. Each chess piece is represented by a letter which denotes the chess piece and a digit which denotes the square on the board.
    6. For example, 'K' is a White King present on square ""a8"".

    The Board Rows are:
    1rb1k2r p1p2ppp 8 3R4 2Q5 4q3 P1P1B1PP 2K2R2 w k - 0 1

    The Board Columns are:
    b1k2r p1p2ppp 8 3R4 2Q5 4q3 P1P1B1PP 2K2R2 w k - 0 1

    The chessboard is divided into 8 rows known as files range from 1-8.
    The chessboard is divided into 8 columns known as ranks range from a-h.

    Total 14 pieces present in the board

    White Pieces: 6 pieces which are 1 x White King, 3 x White Pawn, 1 x White Rook, 1 x White Queen

    Black Pieces: 8 pieces which are 2 x Black Rook, 1 x Black Bishop, 2 x Black Queen, 1 x Black Pawn, 1 x Black King

    The Black Queen is present in the FEN line at position ""e6"".
    The position is determined by the digit present after the letter 'Q'.
    e6 means Black Queen present at square e6.

    Therefore, the Black Queen is present at e6 square.",0
