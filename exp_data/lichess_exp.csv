**Game Analysis, Winner, and Summary of Strategy:**

In this game, White started aggressively with early queen moves to create threats. However, Black responded calmly, focusing on development and undermining White's position. As the game progressed, White's aggressive but uncoordinated play led to weaknesses that Black exploited effectively. Black's strategic maneuvers and focus on piece development provided a solid foundation for counter-attacks and tactical strikes.

The last move by White to develop the bishop indicates a desire to maintain control over the center and possibly prepare for future maneuvers. In the current position, Black seems to have gained an advantage due to White's pawn weaknesses and disjointed development. If Black continues to exploit these weaknesses and coordinate their pieces effectively, they are likely to emerge as the winner in this game. White, on the other hand, needs to regroup, strengthen the pawn structure, and coordinate their pieces to create counterplay and defense against Black's impending threats."
