### Summary of strategies used and winner

Throughout the game, White focused on controlling the center, developing pieces, and pushing for space advantage with pawn breaks. Black, on the other hand, aimed to challenge White's center, gain counterplay on the queenside, and create tactical opportunities.

White's strategy of controlling the center and steadily improving piece activity allowed them to build a strong position, eventually leading to a decisive advantage. In the endgame, White's active pieces and passed pawns proved too much for Black to handle, leading to a checkmate.

Therefore, White emerges as the winner due to their strategic play, center control, and effective piece coordination throughout the game."
