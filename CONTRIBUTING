## Develop a System Service

Our project resource code is mainly distributed in [src](src), [modules](modules), [scripts](scripts), and [utils](utils).

- **Source code** ([src](src)) contains the system entry and basic classes of functions and services.
- **Upper-level developments** ([modules](modules)) contains topics for batch processing, file analysis and parsing, and the deployment and wrapper of [base services](src/services).
Each topic can be stored in a subfolder.
- **Configurations** ([scripts](scripts)) contains the system configuration file and script files of each service.
- **Tools** ([utils](utils)) contains shared tool/utility files and individual such files for each service.

To develop a new service for our project, please create a pull request for each new service.
